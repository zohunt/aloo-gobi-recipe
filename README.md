# Aloo Gobi Recipe 🍛

Welcome to my very first HTML project — a cozy recipe page for **Aloo Gobi**, a warm and hearty North Indian dish made with potatoes and cauliflower. This page was built from scratch using just HTML and a little CSS, and it's the first step in my journey to becoming a full-stack developer.

## 👩‍🍳 What I Used

- HTML5
- CSS (basic styling)
- Semantic tags like `<h1>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<img>`
- A cozy, playful tone (because food should be fun!)

## ✏️ What I Learned

- How to structure a basic HTML document
- How to format content with semantic elements
- How to embed and display an image with `alt` text
- How to write cozy, clear content in code

## 🛠️ Next Steps

- Add more recipes and link them together
- Add responsive design for mobile devices
- Include JavaScript to let users "favorite" or print recipes

Thanks for checking it out! I'm excited to keep learning and building.
